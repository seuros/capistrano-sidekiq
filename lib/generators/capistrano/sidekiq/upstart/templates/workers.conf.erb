# This example config should work with Ubuntu 14.10 and below  It
# allows you to manage multiple Sidekiq instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See sidekiq.conf for how to manage a single Sidekiq instance.
#
# Use "stop workers" to stop all Sidekiq instances.
# Use "start workers" to start all instances.
# Use "restart workers" to restart all instances.
# Crazy, right?
